## Introduction

The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) has initiated development of Human Resource for Health Information System([HRHIS](http://hrhis.moh.go.tz/login)) with the essence of establishing a national database, to address and strengthen existing information system through coordinating and networking of existing human resource data collection systems. MoHSW consulted a team of experts from Department of Computer Science and Engineering([CoICT](https://www.coict.udsm.ac.tz/)) of [University of Dar es Salaam(UDSM)](https://www.udsm.ac.tz/), to take the responsibility of developing, implementing and maintaining [HRHIS](http://hrhis.moh.go.tz/login) system in Tanzania Mainland. As for any big system development the process is not an overnight thing. [HRHIS](http://hrhis.moh.go.tz/login) is evolving, though with a remarkable speed, the inputs of stakeholders are all‚Äêtime required.
